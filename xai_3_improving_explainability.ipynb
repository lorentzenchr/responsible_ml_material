    "\n",
    "[@lundberg2017]\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the last chapter of the XAI part of the lecture \"Responsible Machine Learning with Insurance Applications\". It is dedicated to improving the intrinsic explainability of ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding intrinsic explainability, there is the following basic hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear additive models (like GLMs):** Their model structure is so simple that the effects can be read off directly from the numerical model output.\n",
    "2. **Additive models (like GAMs):** It is still possible to give a complete description of the effects, but they must be visualized for interpretation. \n",
    "3. **Black box models (like boosted trees or neural nets):** These models contain many complex interactions, so that the effects can only be described approximately. Without interaction effects, such models would be additive and as transparent as a GAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundaries are blurred: GLMs can also include nonlinear effects and interaction terms. If one adds many interaction terms to a GLM or a GAM, it becomes almost as complex as a neural network. On the other hand, the complexity of boosted trees models and neural networks can be reduced by enforcing additivity for all or some features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two sections, we will learn how to create such additive and partly additive boosted trees and neural nets. By *partly additive*, we mean models that are additive in some features but have interactions between other variables. It is just another term for \"additive with (possibly complex) interactions\". Examples of such partly additive models in actuarial science are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep the \"time\" effect additive while letting the other covariates interact freely. In this way, the ML model can be manually calibrated to obtain unbiased predictions out-of-time.\n",
    "- Use an additive gender effect while allowing other features to interact. This allows to retrospectively remove a potentially discriminatory gender effect from the ML model. (Why not simply dropping gender from the model?)\n",
    "- The location can be represented by a complex interaction effect between latitude and longitude, leaving all other features additive for interpretability.\n",
    "- Same as the last example, but representing location by a large set of (often highly-correlated) features like \"distance to next bus stop\" or \"distance to next restaurant\", see @mayer2022 for two case studies with real-estate data. (How can such models be used for supervised dimension reduction?)\n",
    "- In a car insurance pricing model, one could use additive features for the driver's  attributes, while allowing the vehicle characteristics (engine size, power, speed, ...) to interact freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will see how monotonic constraints can additionally improve intrinsic interpretability of boosted trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single decision trees do not fit into above hierarchy. They are neither linear nor additive, but still intrinsically interpretable.\n",
    "- For models with link functions, additivity is meant at the link scale, since the back-transformation to the response scale introduces interaction effects. In most cases, we interpret such a model on the link scale."

One way to relax the assumption for boosted trees is to grow trees of depth $\\ell > 1$ (not counting the root node). For instance, if $\\ell = 2$, the model can learn all pairwise interactions (why?). Similarly, larger tree depths allow higher order interactions to be represented. \n",

    "- The additive effect of \"logDensity\" is extremely shaky, which is unsatisfactory. Interestingly, the fully additive model was more stable in this respect. It is possible that the model tries to compensate for an omitted interaction. In the next subsection we will see how this problem can be at least partially solved.\n",

    "## Monotonic constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have improved the intrinsic interpretability of a black box by removing interactions. For tree-based models, another aspect can be exploited: Monotonicity. \n",
    "By monotonicity in a feature, we mean that $m$ is a monotonically increasing or decreasing function in that feature, everything else being fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the usefulness and trustworthiness of a model can drop dramatically if it fails to satisfy certain monotonic constraints. Here two examples:\n",

    "- A claims severity model for car collisions is expected to be monotonically increasing in the car value, everything else being fixed.\n",
    "- A claims frequency model for car collisions is expected to be monotonically decreasing in the deductible, Ceteris Paribus.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do monotonic constraints work? To enforce monotonicity for the $j$th feature in a decision tree, the rule is essentially as follows: A candidate split that violates the condition on its child nodes receives an infinite penalty and is therefore discarded. (Since a tree can split on the same feature multiple times, things are a bit more complicated.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following scheme, Tree A represents a prediction function (on log claims frequency scale) that is monotonically decreasing in the vehicle age. The split on the lower left of Tree B violates this constraint and is discarded (and replaced by some other split).\n",

    "- Monotonicity also translates to tree ensembles such as boosted trees or random forests.\n",
    "- Use a monotonic constraint only if it makes sense conditional on all possible combinations of the other features. Take a house price model, for example: At first glance, predictions should increase monotonically with the number of rooms. At second glance, this is not necessarily a good idea, because for a fixed living area, more rooms are not necessarily better.\n",
    "- A monotonicity constraint helps to reduce wiggliness of an effect.\n",
    "- Furthermore, it can be combined with interaction constraints.\n",
    "- There are also implementations of GAMs, GLMs, and neural nets that allow to take monotonicity into account.\n",
    "- For flexibly modeled effects, violations of desired monotonicity often happens as a consequence of overfitting on outlying feature values, a problem that can already dealt with during feature preprocessing by truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In our French MTPL example, there is no feature for which we should really impose monotonicity. Nevertheless, to illustrate the effect, we will force a negative effect for \"VehAge\" and a positive effect for \"logDensity\" to reduce its extreme wiggliness. Note that \"logDensity\" is modeled additively, while \"VehAge\" can freely interact with other vehicle features. For simplicity, we use the same LightGBM parameters as before."

It consists of two layers only: The input layer represents the features, and the output layer represents the response variable. The values of the output layer are transformed by the exponential \"activation\" function, corresponding to the inverse link function of the Poisson GLM. The output layer is *fully connected* or *dense*, which means that the value of its node is a weighted sum of all node values of the previous layer (in this case, of the input layer), see the left hand side of Scheme 4:\n",

Normally, the gradient descent update steps are computed by backpropagation, which involves applying the chain rule to find the derivatives of the loss function with respect to all parameters. For a simple model like a GLM, this is straightforward. But imagine a deep learning model with 50 hidden layers and a non-linear transformation after each hidden layer!

This may be due to several reasons: First, for simplicity, we represented each feature by a linear function, including some factor variables. Second, the parameters were fitted to only 80% of the training observations. Third, we used gradient descent to fit the parameters, which is a very simple optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More complex models\n",

    "While it is great that a neural network can be used to fit a GLM, its strength lies in its *hidden layers*. The nodes on these hidden layers are latent variables that represent the original input features in a way that optimally predicts the response. The closer a hidden layer is to the output, the more optimal this representation is. This is referred to as *representational learning*: The neural network automatically learns relevant nonlinearities and interaction effects that would have to be added manually in a GLM. For this to work, you need a sufficiently flexible architecture (the layers and their nodes) and enough observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important component are the *activation functions* placed after each hidden layer. They transform the weighted sum of each hidden node non-linearly, thus introducing interaction effects. Typical activation functions are the rectangular linear unit $ReLU(x) = \\text{max}(0, x)$, the standard logistic function (\"sigmoid\") and the nearly identical hyperbolic tangent. The activation function applied to the output node has a different purpose: it maps the network output to the scale of the response, just like the inverse link function in a GLM. A neural network without activation functions could only represent a linear function of the inputs, regardless of how many hidden layers the model has (why?).\n",

    "On the one hand, the model needs a large number of parameters to be flexible enough. On the other hand, too many parameters lead to overfitting. For tabular data, a healthy ratio of rows per parameter is somewhere between 50 and 200. When working with unstructured data, different rules apply.\n",

    "- Compared to the neural additive model, \"VehAge\" (and also the other vehicle-related variables) incorporates interaction effects with other vehicle characteristics. The driver characteristics remain additive.\n",
    "- Since some of the interaction effects are strong, the performance of the model has greatly improved compared to the neural additive model. Its performance is quite close to the unconstrained model.\n",
    "- The performance is worse than that of the corresponding boosted trees model with interaction constraints. Part of the difference can be explained by the fact that the neural network effects are smooth and \"logDensity\" is represented linearly.\n",

    "# Excursion: Tuning Boosted Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters of ML models (including GLMs) are usually selected or *tuned* by the help of train/test splits and (cross-)validation. However, each model class (GLMs, GAMs, random forests, boosted trees, neural nets, ...) has its own peculiarities and subtleties that should be respected. In this section, we will learn how to tune the many hyperparameters of a boosted trees model, such as the objective, the learning rate, the number of trees (= boosting rounds), and further regularization parameters. We will closely follow the suggestions in Chapter \"Trees\" in @mayer2021ml. It would be naive and irresponsible to use a completely untuned boosted trees model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus is on boosted trees, as they are usually among the most powerful modeling techniques for tabular data. In addition, we have learned the elegant workflow to build a strong GLM by analyzing such a model with SHAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective and metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The first decision is to select a meaningful and ideally strictly consistent scoring/loss function for the distributional property $T$. On this basis, the evaluation metric and the objective are determined. The objective is used to *fit* the model, while the evaluation metric is used for model evaluation and parameter selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For pricing models of expected claims frequency and claims severity, one typically uses the corresponding deviance as (strictly consistent) scoring function. The average deviance then serves as both the objective and the evaluation metric.\n",
    "- In many other regression situations for $T = \\mathbb E$, one uses the squared error as strictly consistent loss function. The corresponding objective is the mean squared error (MSE), and the evaluation metric is either the MSE or its root (RMSE).\n",
    "- When $T$ is the median, the absolute error $L(z, y) = |y-z|$ is a strictly consistent scoring function. Its mean then serves as natural evaluation metric and objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of boosting rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting an appropriate number of boosting rounds/trees is important: too few rounds tend to underfitting, while too many will often cause overfitting. A convenient strategy, called *early stopping*, is to calculate the evaluation metric after each boosting round by (cross-)validation. Once performance stops improving over a certain number of rounds, the boosting process is stopped. This approach is particularly useful because a good number of boosting rounds depends strongly on the choice of the other parameters, e.g., the learning rate. Thus, randomly selecting the number of boosting rounds along with the other parameters would often lead to a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate equals the weight of each tree in the final model. Its value (often between 1 and 0.005) can be chosen manually to achieve a reasonable number of boosting rounds by early stopping, aiming for a number between 100 and 1000 trees. Fewer trees will result in too simple a model, while more trees require long to fit. To quickly find a good learning rate, take advantage of the rule that dividing the learning rate by two roughly doubles the number of boosting rounds required for comparable performance. For instance, if you start with a learning rate of 0.2 and the model stops early already after only 50 rounds, you might try out a learning rate of 0.05 and expect a model that stops at about 200 trees (and hopefully performs slightly better).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations of gradient boosted trees typically offer many parameters to control the size of the trees and other aspects of boosting, e.g., \n",
    "\n",
    "- the number of leaf nodes,\n",
    "- the tree depth,\n",
    "- loss penalties,\n",
    "- row and column subsampling rates,\n",
    "- minimal leaf size,\n",
    "- minimal loss improvement to make another split etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are either selected one by one using (cross-)validation or by randomized grid search. There, many random parameter combinations are evaluated and one typically selects the combination with the best (cross-)validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The number of boosting rounds picked by early stopping often compensates for a suboptimal choice of other parameters. In fact, most parameters are highly interdependent in the sense that different parameter combinations can result in similar model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, a simple strategy for selecting good parameters for a boosted trees model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by selecting a meaningful and ideally strictly consistent loss function for the functional $T$ of the respose. This determines the objective and the evaluation metric.\n",
    "2. Choose the learning rate to produce a model with about 100 to 1000 trees, with early stopping by (cross-)validation.\n",
    "3. Select the other parameters manually or by random search using (cross-)validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the performance improvements from Step 3 are modest, so this part can sometimes be skipped, especially when working with large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: French MTPL (LightGBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "How did we select the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model fitted on claims frequencies of the French MTPL data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial step was to choose the Poisson deviance as loss function (strictly consistent for the expectation), determining both the objective and evaluation metric. The other steps are summarized in the code below. Compared to a standard LightGBM tuning workflow, we passed our own (grouped) cross-validation folds to `lgb.cv()`."
