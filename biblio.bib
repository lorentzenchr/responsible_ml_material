  abstract = {Abstract Working with multiple regression analysis a researcher usually wants to know a comparative importance of predictors in the model. However, the analysis can be made difficult because of multicollinearity among regressors, which produces biased coefficients and negative inputs to multiple determination from presum ably useful regressors. To solve this problem we apply a tool from the co-operative games theory, the Shapley Value imputation. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the Shapley Value and show that it provides consistent results in the presence of multicollinearity.

  abstract = {We present a sensitivity analysis-based method for explaining prediction models that can be applied to any type of classification or regression model. Its advantage over existing general methods is that all subsets of input features are perturbed, so interactions and redundancies between features are taken into account. Furthermore, when explaining an additive model, the method is equivalent to commonly used additive model-specific methods. We illustrate the method's usefulness with examples from artificial and real-world data sets and an empirical analysis of running times. Results from a controlled experiment with 122 participants suggest that the method's explanations improved the participants' understanding of the model.},
