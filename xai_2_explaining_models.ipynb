    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second chapter of the XAI part of the lecture \"Responsible Machine Learning with Insurance Applications\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is dedicated to inspecting and explaining supervised learning models. The basic workflow usually follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Study performance of the model.\n",
    "2. Study feature importance.\n",
    "3. Study feature effects, ideally including interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being a fruitful source of information, each of these steps may reveal problems in the modeling process that should be addressed. The fewer problems remain, the higher the confidence in the model and the modeler. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore these steps in detail. The main reference is @molnar2019 and our tutorial [@mayer2020] on XAI in insurance. The main focus is on global, model-agnostic, post-hoc explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Software\n",
    "\n",
    "In the R programming language, the two most popular packages for model-agnostic interpretation are \"DALEX\" [@biecek2018] and \"iml\" [@molnar2018]. We will often work with our \"flashlight\" package [@flashlight2021] since all of its methods are capable of handling case weights. This is particularly important in insurance applications, where many models use some form of weighting, such as exposure, sum insured, or premiums paid\n",
    "\n",
    "All these packages work by specifying an \"explainer object\" that contains all relevant information to make predictions (the model, its prediction function, a reference dataset, ...). Afterwards, calculating model-agnostic explanations is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section on SHAP, we will additionally use the package \"shapviz\" [@shapviz2022].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up explainers\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by loading the data and models from the Chapter \"Introduction\". Then, we set up the explainer objects. "

    "# Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "We start interpreting the models by studying model performance using one or more relevant performance measures (often the average loss or a derived measure) based on a clean model validation strategy. Performance information is almost always of interest. Studying it is also helpful in finding gross errors in the modeling process: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the model performance substantially *lower* than expected? This could indicate that some steps in the data preparation (e.g., a database join) went wrong, or that an important feature is missing in the model. For neural networks: Has the optimization process converged or was the learning process stuck at a local minimum?\n",
    " - Is the performance much *better* than expected? Before proudly presenting the results to the stakeholders, review your validation strategy: are the data partitions truly independent, or are there problematic dependencies between rows that have not been taken into account? Another reason for incorrectly high performance is information leakage from the response variable into a feature. Example: a churn model that uses the feature \"Customer left the company after X years\", where the feature value is only filled in for churned customers. The more you know about the data, the lower the risk of falling into such traps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance is typically evaluated on a hold-out dataset not used for model tuning or model fitting. Comparison with the performance on the training data gives a good indication of how much the model tends to overfit (or more precisely: of the model *optimism*).\n",

    "\n",
    "- It often makes sense to study different types of performance measures. In our example, we considered an absolute and a relative measure.\n",
    "- A flawed validation strategy (see the excursion below for an example) tends to result in biased performance values. Such errors are often overlooked because their detection requires detailed knowledge of the data structure and the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Excursion: Grouped Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example on French claims frequencies, we have split the dataset into train/test by *grouped splitting* on the column \"group_id\". The same logic was also applied in cross-validation to search for good parameter combinations of the boosted trees model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grouped splitting works as follows: Unlike standard random splitting, where each row is randomly assigned to a data partition, all rows in a group are randomly assigned to the same partition. Thus, a group appears in exactly one partition. This ensures that no within-group information is leaked across partitions. Failure to do so may lead to biased performance evaluations and consequently to biased model selection. Typically, very flexible modeling techniques benefit from such bias, which unfortunately means that overfitting is rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouped data occur quite frequently. Here some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In insurance pricing datasets, each policy typically appears multiple times, e.g., once per year.\n",
    "- In loss reserving, claims occurring during an accumulation event (e.g., a hail storm or a flood) are not independent.\n",
    "- Tracking browser behavior of online visitors produces many lines of rows of the same visitor.\n",
    "- An application from banking: financial transactions from clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring data structure during data partitioning is a common flaw in data science. Avoiding it is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Mind your data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "How would the model performances of our GLM and the boosted trees model change if grouping were ignored?\n",

(How is it calculated? What is the impact of grouped data on OOB results?)\n",

However, in other situations, one may want to explicitly use within-group information in the model: An example is an insurance product that is associated with a high claim frequency, such as insurance for large fleets of vehicles. Here, one could apply a policy-specific residual correction according to credibility theory. As with time series data, such *panel-data* require special attention not only in the choice of the validation scheme, but also in feature construction, selection of modeling technique, and calculation of predictions. \n",

    "Besides the pure information gain, variable importance also helps to challenge the correctness of the model. Are the results as expected or not? If a seemingly unimportant variable is one of the top predictors, then maybe some sort of information leakage from the response to that feature has happened (see also the discussion in section \"Performance\"). On the other hand, if a key variable does not show any relevance in the model, this could mean that some mistake happened in data preparation or that the modeler does not yet sufficiently understand the modeling situation or the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different model-specific ways to assess variable importance, here some examples:\n",

    "  - Normalized coefficients or \n",
    "  - partial F/Chi-squared tests per feature.\n",
    "- Tree-based models\n",
    "  - Split gain, i.e., the overall loss gain from splitting on feature $X^{(j)}$ or\n",
    "  - the number of times the feature was used for splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequently applied *model-agnostic* technique is called *permutation importance* introduced in the famous random forest paper [@breiman2001] for random forests and later generalized by @fisher2018 to other models. It measures by how much a relevant performance measure $\\hat S$ (e.g., the average deviance or the RMSE) of a fitted model $\\hat m$, evaluated on a dataset $D$, worsens after randomly shuffling the values of the $j$-th feature. The larger the performance change, the more important the feature.\n",

The use of such transformations contrasts with the bad habit of blindly throwing all available columns into the model.\n",

This is in contrast to modern ML methods, which typically have sufficient flexibility to add complex interaction effects fully automatically.

Another interesting question is: between which variable *pairs* do strong interactions occur?\n",

The part in the parentheses of the numerator measures the difference between the two-dimensional effect surface and the two univariate effects. Thus, $H^2$ can be interpreted as the proportion of variability in the joint effect of $X^{(j)}$ and $X^{(j)}$ unexplained by the main effects. The smaller the value, the weaker the pairwise interaction. A value close to 1 indicates that almost all of the effect of $X^{(j)}$ and $X^{(k)}$ comes from the pairwise interaction. According to this interpretation, it is often easier to work with $H^2$ than with $H$.\n",

    "Another model-agnostic technique for examining the internals of a complex model $m$ goes back to @craven95, see @molnar2019 for a modern take. It works as follows: An intrinsically interpretable model $m_I$, usually a small decision tree, is fitted to the predictions of $\\hat m$ using the same covariates as $m$ and minimizing the mean squared error. $\\hat m_I$ is called a *(global) surrogate model* for $\\hat m$. The higher the R-squared of $\\hat m_I$, the better $\\hat m$ can be explained by studying the surrogate $\\hat m_I$.\n",

    "# Improve Linear Models by XAI\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there are good reasons (e.g. intrinsic explainability) for using a (generalized) linear model as the final model. However, building a strong linear model is quite complex: the modeler must consider *how* to represent the features and where to add nonlinear terms and interactions. A modern way to guide through these steps is to build a black box model and inspect it using XAI to obtain information about where and how to optimize the linear model.\n",
    "Following @mayer2020, the basic logic is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Performance:* How big is the performance difference between the optimized black box model and the initial linear model? If it is rather small, then the initial linear model may already be sufficiently good and does not need to be improved. On the other hand, if the performance difference is large, we can try to improve the linear model based on the next steps.\n",
    "2. *Variable importance:* Did the black box model identify similar features as being important? If not, this could indicate a suboptimal feature representation in the linear model and/or missing interaction effects. This is where the next steps help.\n",
    "3. *Main effects:* Do effects plots (e.g., partial dependence plots) of the important features look similar? If a feature shows highly non-linear effects in the black box model, then we should consider representing that feature in the linear model with the necessary flexibility, e.g., by using polynomials or regression splines.\n",
    "4. *Interaction effects:* Often for simplicity, the initial linear model is built without interaction effects. Examining interaction strength of the black box model gives us an indication of which interaction effects could be added and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through these steps, the modified linear model can be re-examined. Hopefully, the results will now be closer to the optimized black box model while retaining intrinsic explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now try to optimize our GLM based on the insights gained so far: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance: The GLM performs substantially worse than the other two models. Thus, there is still room for improvement.\n",
    "2. Variable importance: According to permutation importance, the age of the car is the most important variable in all models. Apart from that, the rankings between the models are very different. Spending more flexibility to the GLM is indicated.\n",
    "3. Main effects: The ICE plots and the partial dependence plots show large differences for some variables. Examples are the age of the driver and the age of the vehicle, for which linear effects do not seem realistic at all. For these covariates, we decide to use natural cubic splines in our GLM to represent their effects more realistically.\n",
    "4. Interactions: In order to keep the resulting model intelligible, we only include the strongest interaction effect (vehicle brand and vehicle age) as identified by the boosted trees model."

    "# SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (**SH**apley **A**dditive Ex**P**lanations) is the key player in explaining a ML model locally, i.e., around a single observation. It was introduced in @lundberg2017 and has since received much attention, not only when working with tabular data but also with unstructured data like text or images. The basic idea of SHAP is to decompose a model prediction into additive contributions of the features in a fair way. Repeating this process for many observations provides a powerful method for explaining the model as a whole. The roots of the method goes back to a classic result on cooperative game theory [@shapley1953]. Thus, and in contrast to many other local explainability methods, SHAP is based on a solid theoretic foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important local technique is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, @ribeiro2016), primarily used for models with unstructured input like text or image data. It works as follows: An artificial dataset is created with feature values slightly different from those of the observation to be explained. Its predictions are then regressed on a simplified feature space by a white-box surrogate model, such as linear regression, assigning higher weights to more similar observations. This surrogate model provides a local interpretation of the original model in the neighborhood of the selected observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on SHAP, see @mayer2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shapley values\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is SHAP? To answer this question, we first introduce Shapley values from cooperative game theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $\\mathcal M$ denote a set of $p = |\\mathcal M|$ players.\n",
    "- They play a cooperative game with numeric payoff to be maximized. \n",
    "- The contribution (total expected sum of payoffs) of a subset $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M$ (or *coalition*) of the players is measured by a function $v: \\mathcal L \\mapsto \\mathbb R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can the total payoff be distributed fairly among the individual players? The answer was given in @shapley1953: The amount that player $j$ should receive is called *Shapley value* and equals\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\phi_j(v) = \\phi_j = \\sum_{\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M \\setminus\\{j\\}} \\underbrace{\\frac{|\\mathcal L|!(p - |\\mathcal L| - 1)!}{p!}}_\\text{Shapley weight} \\big(\\underbrace{v(\\mathcal L \\cup \\{j\\}) - v(\\mathcal L)}_{\\text{Contribution of player } j}\\big).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, a player's contribution is equal to the weighted average of his or her contribution to each possible coalition $\\mathcal L$ of other players. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be read as the (unweighted) average of the contribution of player $j$ over all $p!$ permutations of players. To see this, consider a permutation of the players. The $|\\mathcal L|$ players appearing prior to player $j$ form the coalition $\\mathcal L$, while the $p - |\\mathcal L| - 1$ players $\\mathcal Q$ *after* position $j$ do not play. We can permute the players in $\\mathcal L$, and also the players in $\\mathcal Q$ without effect on the contribution of player $j$. This leads to the numerator of the Shapley weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "To characterize \"fairness\", Shapley postulated axioms that may be described by these four desirable properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** $v(\\mathcal M) = \\sum_{j = 0}^p \\phi_j$, where $\\phi_o = v(\\emptyset)$ denotes the non-distributed payoff (often set to 0 in cooperative games).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Symmetry:** If $v(\\mathcal L \\cup \\{i\\}) = v(\\mathcal L \\cup \\{j\\})$ for every $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M \\setminus\\{i, j\\}$, then $\\phi_i = \\phi_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dummy player:** If $v(\\mathcal L \\cup \\{j\\}) = v(\\mathcal L)$ for all coalitions $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M \\setminus\\{j\\}$, then $\\phi_j = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linearity:** Consider two cooperative games with gain functions $v$ and $w$. Then, $\\phi_j(v + w) = \\phi_j(v) + \\phi_j(w)$ and $\\phi_j(\\alpha v) = \\alpha \\phi_j(v)$ for all $1 \\le j \\le p$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley values are the only way to distribute total winnings among players in a way that satisfies these four properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shapley values in statistics and ML\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, Shapley values were proposed by @lipovetsky2001 as a strategy to decompose the R-squared of a linear regression into additive contributions of the covariates. Their approach was based on retraining the model for every feature subset. Other early work on Shapley values in statistics and ML include @strumbelj2010, @strumbelj2014, and @lundberg2017. They propose to use Shapley values to decompose *predictions* into feature contributions. Thus, the outcome of the cooperative game is the prediction, and the features are the players. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the prediction $m(\\boldsymbol x)$ of a given feature vector $\\boldsymbol x$ is to be decomposed into contributions $\\phi_j \\in \\mathbb R$, $1 \\le j \\le p$, such that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  m(\\boldsymbol x) = \\phi_o + \\sum_{j = 1}^p \\phi_j,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where typically $\\phi_o = \\mathbb E(m(\\boldsymbol X))$. Only if the $\\phi_j$ are Shapley values, the decomposition will be fair. In order to apply Shapley's formula, a contribution function $v$ must be selected. A natural candidate is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  v(\\mathcal L) = m(\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L$ represents the components in the feature subset $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M$ selected from the full feature set $\\mathcal M$. \n",
    "Since models cannot simply \"turn off\" some features during prediction, the estimation of $m(\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L)$ is highly non-trivial, and there is some controversy (see e.g., @sundararajan2019 or @janzing2020) whether to approximate it using marginal expectations $\\mathbb E_{\\mathbf X_{\\mathcal M \\setminus \\mathcal L}}(m(\\boldsymbol X))$ or conditional expectations $\\mathbb E(m(\\boldsymbol X \\mid \\mathbf x_\\mathcal L))$. The core question is: should the statistical dependence between features in $\\mathcal L$ and features in $\\mathcal M \\setminus \\mathcal L$ be broken (marginal) or not (conditional)? The rules of causal inference require the former, while statistically, the latter would be more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist several algorithms to calculate SHAP values for an observation $\\mathbf x$. Three particularly important ones are the following (from very slow to very fast):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monte-Carlo sampling** [@strumbelj2010]: To calculate $\\phi_j$ for a particular $j$, the contributions $m(\\mathbf x_{\\mathcal L \\cup \\{j\\}}) - m(\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L)$ are calculated as marginal expectations for many randomly sampled feature subset $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M \\setminus \\{j\\}$ and then plugged into Shapley's formula. Marginal expectations are calculated empirically with respect to some background data set. This method is model-agnostic, but either very slow or very imprecise.\n",
    "- **Kernel SHAP** [@lundberg2017]: Another model-agnostic algorithms is called Kernel SHAP. Like Monte-Carlo sampling, it estimates $m(\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L)$ via marginal expectations for many $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M$. Then, it uses a regression trick to obtain all $\\phi_j$ directly without plugging into Shapley's formula, see @covert2021 for details. @aas2021 proposed a version using conditional expectations instead.\n",
    "- **TreeSHAP** [@lundberg2020] is a method tailored for decision trees. It estimates $m(\\mathbf x_\\mathcal L)$ by a conditional expectation using a recursive (path-dependent) algorithm identical to a method for calculating exact partial dependence plots for decision trees in @friedman2001, page 27. To evaluate Shapley's formula, the basic algorithm must be applied to each $\\mathcal L \\subseteq \\mathcal M$ and is therefore exponentially slow in $p$. Fortunately, the algorithm has been implemented in a way that evaluates all subsets $\\mathcal L$ together, resulting in an exponential speedup. Also a slower \"interventional\" version exists that estimates marginal expectations. Thanks to additivity of SHAP values, TreeSHAP works well for tree ensembles such as boosted trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into more detail about *how* the above methods work but rather note:\n",
    "\n",
    ">SHAP has a solid theoretical foundation. In practice, some of it is lost because statistics is not mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: In the following two situations, exact Shapley values can be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p = 1$, i.e., there is only a single feature $Z$. Here, the contribution of $Z$ is simply $\\phi_1 = m(z) - \\phi_o$.\n",
    "- $m$ is a linear regression with *uncorrelated* features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  m(\\boldsymbol x) = \\underbrace{\\beta_0}_{\\phi_o} + \\underbrace{\\beta_1 x^{(1)}}_{\\phi_1} + \\dots + \\underbrace{\\beta_p x^{(p)}}_{\\phi_p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(using mean-centered features for notational simplicity), see @aas2021 for a proof.\n",

    "- As with permutation importance, vehicle age is considered the most important variable. Otherwise, the ranking is quite different. The interpretation of SHAP importance is straightforward: on average, the vehicle age shifts the prediction up or down the log-frequency scale by about 0.15. With plus or minus 0.025, the average impact from \"VehGas\" is much smaller.\n",
    "- The beeswarm plot also shows the *direction* of the effect: We can see that a low vehicle age is associated with a strong positive effect. The features in such a beeswarm plot are usually ordered by their SHAP importance.\n",

    "- The SHAP values of observations with a vehicle age of 0 are very high. This means that new vehicles strongly increase the expected claims frequency. The effect for ages between one and twelve years is quite close to 0. For older vehicles, a clear negative trend can be seen.\n",
    "- For a given vehicle age, SHAP values differ from observation to observation. This vertical scatter means that there are interaction effects with other features of the model (why?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "At least two approaches are common to study interaction effects using SHAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SHAP interactions: SHAP decomposes a prediction into additive contributions of each feature. In the same vein, @lundberg2020 introduced *SHAP interactions*, which decompose a prediction into additive contributions of each feature *pair*. Compared to ordinary SHAP, the computational complexity increases by a factor $p$, which is why SHAP interaction values are mainly used with the very fast TreeSHAP algorithm, i.e., for tree-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Heuristics: Several heuristics are available that try to identify the feature that explains most of the vertical scatter in the dependence plot conditional on the value on the horizontal axis. The selected feature is then visualized on the color axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",

    "- The plot shows *how* the interaction manifests itself: \"B12\" vehicles increase the expected claim frequency for brand-new cars, while otherwise decreasing it. This is consistent with what we found by examining the conditional partial dependence plot in the section on interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- SHAP decompositions explain the fitted model, not the actual underlying relationships. Therefore, a SHAP analysis is as good or as bad as the model. This also means that we can select observations from either the training or the test data.\n",
    "- For models involving link functions, predictions are usually decomposed on the scale of the link.\n",
    "- Thanks to additivity, the SHAP values of a claims frequency model and its corresponding severity model can be combined on the logarithmic scale. This provides explanations for the resulting pure premium model.\n",

    "- The SHAP dependence plots show quite realistic effects. For most features they give a similar impression as the corresponding partial dependence plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is amazing how much information can be generated with so few lines of code. If the ultimate goal of the modeling task is to obtain a strong (generalized) linear model, we can develop an ML model, evaluate its performance, perform a compact SHAP analysis, and then use these findings to craft a strong GLM. This adopts the logic from the section \"Improving Linear Models through XAI\" in an extremely efficient manner.\n",

    "From the plots above, we could say:\n",

    "*Importance:* \"VehAge\", \"logDensity\" and \"DrivAge\" are the three most important features. The GLM will hopefully benefit if their effects are well represented. There is no variable that we should omit.\n",
